1,huh,2023-10-26T08:18:26Z,2023-10-26T08:18:26Z,405,"I think it‚Äôs clear to everyone that if Teddy and Bruce knew what was on the line, they would of told him to finish the experiment instead of raising them"

4,Siubhan Mora-Bruce,2023-10-26T06:38:05Z,2023-10-26T06:40:24Z,161,"when they said you don&#39;t need to pre-rinse, they didn&#39;t mean you could leave half a bowl of oatmeal in your bowl. You need to scrape the extra food into the trash lmao"
5,AchDeToni,2023-10-26T16:12:57Z,2023-10-26T16:14:43Z,188,They murdered that dish washer and then shamed it for not doing its job because it was dead. Just insane.

7,The Tom Ward Show,2023-10-26T11:39:24Z,2023-10-26T11:39:24Z,737,"Thanks so much for Ethan and the crew for having me on for this very serious, scientific experiment. I had so much fun and you guys gave such positive feedback! And Dan was awesome, Ethan trying to mess with me with the stare down was great, Cam calling me Mr. Clean was so funny and just sitting in with the crew was so fun! And thanks to you guys, the H3 community, for all the love and support! Peace and love, peace and love! Tom"
8,Cassandra Schmitt,2023-10-26T13:34:27Z,2023-10-26T13:34:27Z,97,Since we are putting a pause on leftovers I think we need a Thursday episode just of a new dishwasher experiment that isn&#39;t compromised
9,The Bread Pill,2023-10-26T07:18:53Z,2023-10-26T07:18:53Z,105,they couldn&#39;t have done a more poorly planned test lmao

12,Hannah Reed,2023-10-26T01:38:35Z,2023-10-26T01:38:35Z,1088,"Not only was it not completed with the cycle, but I think it‚Äôs completely unfair to keep so much food on the dishes, ANY person EVER scrapes the plate before loading it. No one puts fully loaded food dishes in the washer. Pre rinse or not"
13,Allison McKenzie,2023-10-26T21:46:43Z,2023-10-26T21:46:43Z,78,I didn&#39;t realize Dan took one of our best bowls to work for this cursed experiment...
14,XTheJenovaProjectX,2023-10-26T23:44:21Z,2023-10-26T23:44:21Z,25,Zach is so damn good at his job. The way he hit the ‚Äústop it with the tumatus‚Äù and ‚Äúall different flavors‚Äù while Olivia was talking about salads. Seamless and hilarious.
15,Brandon Zarzyczny,2023-10-26T04:50:56Z,2023-10-26T17:48:34Z,120,"Thanks guys, but you&#39;re definitely going to have to throw that dish washer into a dumpster now. What your experiment definitively proved is that you shouldn&#39;t put a bunch of glue and stuff into a dishwasher, and you should probably scrape any chunks of stuff into the trash before running the dishwasher. The whole pre-rinse discussion however is still up in the air. I definitely vote that you guys buy the most expensive dishwasher you can find and run the experiment again without stopping it early and without non-food items tainting the results."
16,Peter Cimino,2023-10-26T12:45:06Z,2023-10-26T12:45:06Z,59,I‚Äôm a little blown away that we‚Äôve somehow conflated a pre-rinse with scraping. Who said you‚Äôre not suppose to scrape the food off?? Of course you scrape!
17,Marcin Urban,2023-10-26T11:50:36Z,2023-10-26T11:51:04Z,43,"I call, we got &quot;weights in fish&quot; with that unfinished dishwasher cleaning test"
18,Sacha Russo,2023-10-26T00:13:56Z,2023-10-26T00:13:56Z,2134,"There is absolutely no WAY the dishwasher experiment was in any way, shape or form a fair assessment of the prewash debate"
19,Alistair Kent,2023-10-26T10:18:16Z,2023-10-26T10:18:16Z,25,Only on this show can we make washing the dishes an entire segment üòÇüòÖ
20,Don Juan,2023-10-26T05:03:47Z,2023-10-26T05:04:04Z,43,"Not that I didn&#39;t appreciate his soundbites before, but having Zach back on the soundboard after he was gone for that one episode last week renewed &amp; supercharged my admiration."
21,Arden Elwell,2023-10-26T16:59:37Z,2023-10-26T16:59:37Z,23,"This was equivalent to putting rocks in a blender, breaking the blender, and then never wanting to use a blender again LMAOOOO"
22,nothin to see here,2023-10-26T05:59:52Z,2023-10-26T05:59:52Z,52,This is a CLASSIC. Love when they stick to the goofs and gaffs. Deep diving on that guy‚Äôs podcast highlights was gold

24,LeedlLiz,2023-10-26T00:18:21Z,2023-10-26T00:18:21Z,1303,"The way they put multiple forms of glue, spackle AND slime into a dishwasher but blame the cycle not finishing for the reason nothing‚Äôs clean is so insane"
25,ZYTUSA,2023-10-26T08:31:44Z,2023-10-26T08:31:44Z,20,"For the dishwasher experiment, you can put flashlights and a webcam inside the washer , and periodically check in on the washing process!!"
26,Kassandra,2023-10-26T12:46:33Z,2023-10-26T12:46:33Z,10,How the hell did so many people think it was a good idea to put dishes full of food into the dishwasher?
27,Liv D,2023-10-26T23:49:13Z,2023-10-26T23:49:13Z,10,Ian asking for chicken like an absolute psychopath just sent me üòÇ

34,LeedlLiz,2023-10-26T04:53:49Z,2023-10-26T04:53:49Z,34,I can&#39;t wait for Ethan to file an insurance claim to fix the pipes/sewage system in the building and the agent shows him this episode and him admitting to flushing paper towels down the toilet

126,oscar pearson,2023-10-26T17:24:47Z,2023-10-26T17:35:06Z,2,I am unconvinced. We agreed no prewashing but youve still got to scrape the majority off. Also a regular wash cycle will have a couple tough ones and mostly just plates with a bit of caked on stuff. I would like to see that test.<br><br>Also the dream song slaps.
127,Sydney Fleischman,2023-10-26T15:22:12Z,2023-10-26T15:22:12Z,1,A couple months ago I was fired from my job because I opened the dishwasher while it was running. True story.

140,Alexander Orr,2023-10-26T08:32:35Z,2023-10-26T08:32:35Z,2,We demand a re-test this violated dish washing protocol! You need to at LEAST scape the plates/pans they left like 2 pounds of oatmeal and egg. That‚Äôs why the time kept going up it was throwing the food all over and the sensors kept picking it up as dirty. I did a run myself a day ago testing this and the dishes were spotless.

First time is the pre-wash where you‚Äôre suppose to put in the prewash detergent.  The filter in dishwasher also needs to be cleaned after every 3rd wash cycle.

EVERY other place (like, EVERY other place) I think is too sweet with unnatural-y flavors. They mix their drinks with real fruit, not just flavorings, and one of the drinks for example is this super yummy tea with blocks of watermelon, lemon, lime, and grapefruit inside that you can snack on while you drink it. Another fav is avocado ice cream (it‚Äôs an avocado smoothie with a ball of vanilla ice cream that sits at the bottom). No weird avocado flavoring, just super good light avocado-tea smoothie. I have no recommendations for LA lol but my point here is that the more natural the drink the better - usually I can tell by the pictures and descriptions (my rule of thumb is if the drink is just one color it probably tastes like shit lol)."

314,Misrupt,2023-10-26T14:13:27Z,2023-10-26T14:24:05Z,1,"Dishwasher experiment was botched so hard. First of all this load was an anomaly, even if you dont wash the dishes before putting them in, these were deliberately messy as a test, which is fine, but then you put them all together and the dishwasher is fighting, its gonna take more time because it will go until the last dish is not letting off dirt. <br><br>While I agree, 6 hours to wash dishes is ridiculous and you might as well hand wash them (I do), there were so many variables here that were just thrown out the window. You had AB try and &quot;rinse&quot; them after stopping the load short, the dishes were hot and had soap, after you stop it and hand rinse them, they are no longer hot, making food stick again, as well as a completely different pressure of water.<br><br>I think this experiment has to be run with multiple loads, some being mostly normal with a few unwashed, some being half and half, and some being all not washed before going in, then you compare the times of each load, as well as how many dishes, what food was on them and where they were located. You need to have some constants between the loads of the same dishes with the same messiness. <br><br>Then you could compare the cleanliness of the dishes that were the same based on the difficulty of the wash and the amount. This will give you more accurate results on the dishwashers capabilities as well as its thresholds of its capability to clean certain things. <br><br>If you really wanted to test this theory harder, you would try multiple models of dishwashers as well as messing with water pressures, and soaps. <br><br>Overall, I was never good at science but if you&#39;re going to act so invested about something, at least attempt to do it right.<br><br>Edit: Regardless though, imo you should atleast scrape/rinse off food before the dishwasher so you dont get food in there and have to clean that eventually. However, this was a frustrating segment, because even if I am on the other side of it, I still think it needs a fair test, multiple times to really confirm. But I will say if you only eat half of your oatmeal, just scrape the rest into the trash and then put it in the dishwasher."

But seeing this specific channel, they definitely seem to be doing it from an entertainment standpoint, not from poverty so you guys shouldn&#39;t feel bad. Most villages in recent years are doing much better financially due to being more or less self sufficient, it&#39;s more of the urban middle class that are struggling financially because of the massive class difference with the rich. <br>Also the people looking unhappy is prolly because of them being awkward around a camera, not because they&#39;re being forced. <br>Much love to the podcast and the crew! &lt;3"

That means the propellers inside were probably barely turning and probably so clogged that barely any pressure was reaching the dishes.<br><br>This was literally the stupidest test ever because you would not put all that same lose food waste into a sink and wash in that same water - at the very least you&#39;d scraps the lose food off and had you dont that this over flowing would probably not have happened.<br><br>There is a very good chance you broke the dishwasher permanently too, because that noise was the pumps propellor grinding on food waste which should never be able to get into that part of the dishwasher, meaning there was no chance the pump was working at full pressure and therefore the washer was never going to clean.<br><br>Furthermore I notice you have an expose element in that dishwasher which also means that is the oldest design on the market from over 20 years ago and is not even legal in most countries because it&#39;s a literal fire hazard and highly inefficient which means it&#39;s very definitely a cheap piece of junk.<br><br>Modern dishwashers have internal elements and a much more robust and extensive filtration system which you basically destroyed in that model - this is proved by food being in the motor. And, because modern dishwashers have better filtration systems they should have coped noticeably better, even with your stupidity.<br><br>Frankly the test was over the second you put a bowl that was completely full of oatmeal in the machine, it was never going to wash with all of that clogging the filter.

A good dishwasher is normally over $1500<br><br>What your washer undoubtedly has are two much cheaper devices that guide its operation times. <br><br>One is a pressure sensor and another is a water level sensor. It&#39;s complicated but these two sensors can monitor the fill times and how the pressure changes at what point in the cycle to determine reasonably well how soiled the items are.<br><br>After that it adjusts the cycle and the durations of each stage accordingly. Your cycle time is going down very slowly because you put it on a normal cycle which was completely wrong for the dishes you put in there and the machine is trying to accommodate as best it can.<br><br>However nothing it does will solve the problem because you already skipped important stages by choosing the wrong load type at the start so it will not clean properly.

1002,Soft Kitty,2023-10-26T06:35:06Z,2023-10-26T06:35:06Z,1,"It&#39;s wild to me how badly all of you understand the operations of dishwashers.<br><br>A small kitchen sink hold 20 litres of water and you can never wash even half of a full load of dishes from a dishwasher in a sink without changing out the water at least one time.<br>A dishwasher uses between 9 and 15 litres of water for a full cycle unless it&#39;s very cheap and poor quality.<br><br>What&#39;s more the dishwasher is only heating a tiny fraction of the water it uses overall, whereas all the water in the sink wash is always hot - but importantly never hot enough to sterilise, therefore you are getting an inferior wash in a sink, and the water is not filter through a progressive micro filter so you are always putting dirty water on the dishes in a sink except for the very first items.<br><br>The pump in a dishwasher requires very little energy to run and the heating element is a hyper efficient in line water heater, which is dramatically more efficient than a kitchen sink which receives hot water from a central source which is not remotely as efficient as micro heating water to demand.<br><br>Also being centralised means the water travels the distance of piping in your home, meaning you waste an average of 4 litres of hot water before you even get hot water to the sink. Thus the dishwasher typically work out using a fraction of the electricity.<br><br>I have never heard of this insane theory of having garbage disposals inside dishwasher and I believe that&#39;s either delusional, made up, or in so few brands and models it&#39;s not even relevant - One thing is certain, it&#39;s a monumentally stupid idea, because it&#39;s not needed based on the design of dishwashers.<br>I have certainly never once seen a dishwasher with a garbage disposal, not ever heard of one.<br><br>I have heard however that you can attach the outlet hose of the dishwasher to the garbage disposal in the sink which is still not relevant because no large items ever pass the filtration system of a dishwasher - that&#39;s why you must clean the filters every single month.<br><br>Most importantly a domestic dishwasher absolutely could have washed all those things except the dried glue and paint if it was set for the most heavy duty cycle and allowed to complete, and began the cycle with a clean filter. Except for the fact that you 100% would have clogged all the filters of the appliance and would have needed to clean them out mid cycle because no-one on earth puts a bowl completely full of oatmeal in the dishwasher without at least scraping the excess off it first.<br><br>The importance of using the correct cycles in dishwashers, and the correct detergent, and having clean filters cannot be overstated. For example the fastest cycles are essentially just for glassware and very lightly soiled items.<br><br>You don&#39;t seem capable of grasping this basic concept.<br><br>As for commercial dishwashers:<br><br>They have a super fast cycle time of approximately 1 minute because - THEY DO NOT WASH DISHES!!!!!  - They sterilise the dishes which is required by law. All of the dishwashing in a restaurant is handled by a person and a very high pressure spray hose cleaning the dishes BEFORE they go into the dishwasher.<br>That&#39;s simply how it works.<br><br>All a commercial dishwasher is ever doing is a super hot high pressure rinse and sterilise cycle.<br><br>Virtually none of what you people are saying about dishwasher is remotely accurate, and this test was incredibly asinine."

Also many pesticides cannot be easily washed off due to the surfactants used to make them adhere to plant surfaces or because they become incorporated into the tissues of the crop. Yes the Organic labeling and regulation system has many deep flaws, Certified Naturally Grown is far superior. There are regenerative agriculture models that successfully grow crops with less inputs and yield crops with greater nutrient density because of it&#39;s focus on soil health. I design and consult for these farmers for a living and am currently engaged in multiple grant funded research projects demonstrating support of these claims. I just wish Ethan didn&#39;t speak so matter-of-fact about nuanced issues he is far from being an expert on."

Of course you need to rinse it, if you dont want to clog the dishwasher. People who say you dont need to rinse, are just either too lazy to rinse, or had lazy parents who never taught them to rinse and thus they think its normal not to rinse."

They never seem to be prepared or have interesting topics and the whole show literally revolves around them ordering food lol. ‚ÄúOh I had some compelling things I wanted to talk about at the top of the show and forgot, aw well never mind - foods here show over üôÑ.

Then they order food, listen to more food talk. Not very funny at all. Prolly check back into the h3 pod in another 4 months and see if it&#39;s decent.. But this is the lamest OFR i have ever seen"
